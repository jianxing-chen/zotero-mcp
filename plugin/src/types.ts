// The contract between the three layers of the chat plugin. Read plugin/DESIGN.md first.
//
//   agent/  speaks ACP to a bridge process and emits ChatEvents      (no DOM, no Zotero)
//   ui/     renders ChatEvents and collects input                     (DOM only, no Zotero, no Subprocess)
//   zotero/ glues the two to Zotero: context, reader, storage, spawn  (the only layer that touches Zotero APIs)
//
// Only erasable TypeScript (no enum, no parameter properties, no namespaces): node runs these files
// directly in tests and esbuild bundles them for Gecko. Relative imports carry the `.ts` extension.
